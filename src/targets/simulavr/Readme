You need patched version of simulavr (from debian simulavr package)
(simulavr_0.1.2.2-7 from stretch/sid)

You can found shell script that can compile patched version of simulavr in
targets/simulavr/compile_simulavr.sh

you can install compiled package system wide or use only binary
(targets/simulavr/tmp/simulavr-0.1.2.2/src/simulavr)


Simulation can be attached directly to pcscd as simulated reader.

Compile simulated reader:

$ make -f Makefile.console

and compile binary for simulavr:

$ make -f Makefile.simulavr


Then run as root:

# build/simulavr/run_pcscd.sh

on another console then run:

# avr-gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1212" build/simulavr/card.elf

In avr-gdb next commands to start simulation:

(gdb) load
(gdb) cont



Simulated card is now available (after ~ 10 sec).. you can check this by running:

$ pcsc_scan



In avr-gdb use CTRL-C to break execution, then you can insert break points
or examine registers etc.  CTRL-C does not break avr-gdb immediately, APDU
must be readed to return control into avr-gdb. Use for example:

echo "00 a4 00 00 00" |scriptor

to interrupt avr-gdb and get command line in avr-gdb.
